                    <p class="think__details__info__cont">The proposal of the present project of Design Thinking is focused on the Human because its main axis is to improve the security needs with respect to the basic lighting of houses and urban institutions, which have the tendency towards the eco efficiency of energy, which contributes to the viability from an ecological point of view. The project is functional as they demonstrate the importance of using the energy generated in the soil through chemical reactions. The project participants are involved in the development of the project because, through the designation of tasks and dates, a plan was drawn up to comply with the project within the deadlines and fulfilling the requested requirements. Likewise, everyone has committed to successfully lead the enterprise.</p>

                    <p class="think__details__info__cont">The proposal on ecological lamps is of high social impact since it implies the development of technology and the use of clean energies to provide light to rural areas that hardly have access to the electrical network and that even resort to the use of candles or candlesticks with gas, which report many cases of fatal accidents.
                    The proposal on ecological lamps is of high economic impact, because it is an idea of ​​sustainability with the environment and that can contribute with lighting or as an energy source to charge some electronic device. If a study of production and sales costs is carried out, a profit can be obtained from a positive margin, for which reason it is advisable to study in depth the market of this niche, as well as experiences of success from abroad that allow to scale up the production in a stage more advanced in the future.

                    <p class="think__details__info__cont">
                    •   The proposal is based on reality, since if we look more at the approach to the rural sector of the region, which does not currently have access to the electric power network and innovation opportunities within the region. While for the urban sector, it is observed that some institutions and households choose to keep the house or company illuminated for security purposes, but that in the long run they represent a liability and a cost that many times it is necessary to cover due to the insecurity that exists. lives in the city of Arequipa.
                    Regarding the innovation aspect, the development of the product is taken into account through duly identified studies and patents. The Soil Lamp is a "ground lamp", designed by Marieke Staps, which derives its energy from the earth. However, what we seek is to innovate in the design, the resource, the parts of it and its possible alternatives that represent a correct balance of the cost benefit in the Arequipa market, all in a framework of sustainability and respect for the environment .</p>
